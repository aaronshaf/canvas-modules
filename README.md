## Mock API, and proxy API

By default a mock API is used. If you would like to test against a running instance of Canvas, uncomment the [api line in gruntconf.coffee](https://github.com/aaronshaf/canvas-modules/blob/master/gruntfile.coffee#L17).

## To do

* Automatically generate main.js (see [Ryan's Rakefile](https://github.com/rpflorence/canvas-client-app/blob/aafa96e50fe529fab35e4c1ed79f73fa3ec7d760/Rakefile#L34-L59))
* Share canvas-global's CSS
* Grunt task for export into canvas-global?
* Make tests work in either tests/** or in main controller/route/model directories
